## **E**arth **O**bservation **API**

`eoAPI` combines several *state-of-the-art* projects to create a full Earth Observation API. Each service can be used and deployed independently, but `eoAPI` creates the interconnections between each service:

- **pgSTAC** database [https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac)

- **STAC API** built on top of [https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi)

- **STAC Items And Mosaic Raster Tiles** API built on top of [https://github.com/stac-utils/titiler-pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/titiler-pgstac)

- **OGC Features and Vector Tiles** API built on top of [https://github.com/developmentseed/tipg](https://github.com/developmentseed/tipg)

- **A STAC Catalog browsing UI** based on the radiant earth browser : [https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser)

## üåç eoAPI: An Open-Source Community Project

`eoAPI` is proudly open-source and driven by a dedicated community of contributors. We believe in the power of open collaboration and welcome anyone to contribute, discuss, and grow this tool. Join the conversations on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoAPI/discussions) and make a difference in the Earth Observation realm.


---

## Getting started

The easiest way to start exploring the different eoAPI services is with *Docker*. Clone this repository and start the multi-container *Docker* applications using `Compose`:

```
git clone https://github.com/developmentseed/eoAPI.git
cd eoAPI
docker compose up
```

Once the applications are *up*, you'll need to add STAC **Collections** and **Items** to the PgSTAC database. If you don't have these available, you can follow the [MAXAR open data demo](https://github.com/vincentsarago/MAXAR_opendata_to_pgstac) (or get inspired by the other [demos](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoAPI/tree/main/demo)).

Then you can start exploring your dataset with:

  - the STAC Metadata service [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
  - the Raster service [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
  - the browser UI [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085)

If you've added a vector dataset to the `public` schema in the Postgres database, they will be available through the **Vector** service at [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083).

### Local deployment

The services can be deployed altogether locally with `docker compose up`.

Alternatively, you may install the libraries and launch the applications manually:

<details>

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade virtualenv
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@0.0.0.0:5439/postgis  # Connect to the database of your choice

python -m pip install uvicorn

###############################################################################
# Install and launch the application
# Select one of the following

###############################################################################
# STAC
python -m pip install "psycopg[binary,pool]" stac-fastapi-pgstac
python -m uvicorn stac_fastapi.pgstac.app:app --port 8081 --reload

###############################################################################
# RASTER
python -m pip install "psycopg[binary,pool]" titiler-pgstac
python -m uvicorn titiler.pgstac.main:app --port 8082 --reload

###############################################################################
# VECTOR
python -m pip install tipg
python -m uvicorn tipg.main:app --port 8083 --reload
```

Note: Python libraries might have incompatible dependencies, which you can resolve by using a virtual environment for each one.

</details>

### Deployment on the cloud

#### Kubernetes

[eoapi-k8s](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoapi-k8s) contains IaC and Helm charts for deploying eoAPI services on AWS and GCP.

#### AWS CDK

[eoapi-cdk](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoapi-cdk) defines a set of AWS CDK constructs that can be used to deploy eoAPI services on AWS. An official example usage of these constructs can be found at [eoapi-template](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoapi-template).


## Deployment with custom runtimes

An example of custom eoAPI runtimes and deployment can be found at [eoapi-devseed](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoapi-devseed).
