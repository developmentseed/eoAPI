## **E**arth **O**bservation **API**

`eoAPI` combines several *state-of-the-art* projects to create a full Earth Observation API. Each service can be used and deployed independently but `eoAPI` creates the interconnections between each service:

- **pgSTAC** database [https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac)

- **STAC API** built on top of [https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi)

- **STAC Items And Mosaic Raster Tiles** API built on top of [https://github.com/stac-utils/titiler-pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/titiler-pgstac)

- **OGC Features and Vector Tiles** API built on top of [https://github.com/developmentseed/tipg](https://github.com/developmentseed/tipg)

## üåç eoAPI: An Open-Source Community Project

`eoAPI` is proudly open-source and driven by a dedicated community of contributors. We believe in the power of open collaboration and welcome anyone to contribute, discuss, and grow this tool with us. Join the conversations on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoAPI/discussions) and make a difference in the Earth Observation realm.

## Why should you use `eoAPI`

- **Focus on your use case:**¬†`eoAPI`¬†is used for large-scale data processing, building geographic information systems (GIS), creating real-time data applications, climate research and environmental monitoring, machine learning model training, and more.

- **Unified Repository:**¬†`eoAPI`¬†provides a single, unified repository to several state-of-the-art Earth Observation (EO) data services, including Metadata search (STAC), Raster, and Vector services. This can simplify the process of accessing and working with these services.

- **Interoperability:**¬†`eoAPI`¬†is designed to enable interoperability among its included services. This can make building complex applications that leverage different types of EO data easier.

- **Open Source and Community Support:**¬†As an open-source project,¬†`eoAPI`¬†allows developers to inspect its code, contribute to its development, and use it as a base for custom solutions. It also benefits from the support and innovation of a community of developers and EO data users.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:**¬†Each service in¬†`eoAPI`¬†can be used or deployed independently, which provides a lot of flexibility. If a developer's application only requires one or two of eoAPI's services, they don't need to deploy the entire suite.

- **Facilitate Earth Observation Tasks:**¬†`eoAPI`¬†includes specialized tools for working with EO data, such as dynamic tiling, metadata searching, and features/vector tiles API. These can significantly facilitate EO data processing, analysis, and visualization.

- **Ease of Deployment:**¬†`eoAPI`¬†supports containerized deployment using Docker, making it easier to set up, scale, and maintain applications built on it. Spin up the demo locally and start experimenting in minutes.

## Services Overview


- **STAC Metadata**: Built with [stac-fastapi.pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi) and extended with a custom extension to connect it to **`TiTiler`** and a **[Search Viewer](http://localhost:8081/index.html)**. See [docs](http://localhost:8081/docs) for API details.

- **Raster Tiles**: Built with [titiler-pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/titiler-pgstac) and [pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac) to enable large scale mosaic based on results of STAC searches queries. See [docs](http://localhost:8082/docs) for API details.

- **OGC Features & Vector Tiles**: Built with [tipg](https://github.com/developmentseed/tipg) to create a lightweight OGC Features and Tiles API with a PostGIS database. See [docs](http://localhost:8083/api.html) for API details.

See [service details](./services.md) for more information.

*Note: The documentation links referenced require lauching the application with `docker compose` or another deployment*.

## Getting started

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/developmentseed/eoAPI.git`
- Navigate to the project: `cd eoAPI`
- Run services with `docker compose up`
- Follow the [MAXAR open data demo](https://github.com/vincentsarago/MAXAR_opendata_to_pgstac) (or get inspired by the other [demos](./demo/)) to load some data into eoAPI
- Checkout the [Search Viewer](http://localhost:8081/index.html), and the API documentation ([STAC Metadata](http://localhost:8081/docs), [Raster Tiles](http://localhost:8082/docs), [Vector Tiles](http://localhost:8083/api.html))

Alternatively, you may launch the application locally:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade virtualenv
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install "psycopg[binary,pool]" uvicorn
python -m pip install runtime/eoapi/{SERVICE}  # SERVICE should be one of `raster, vector, stac`

export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@0.0.0.0:5439/postgis  # Connect to the database of your choice

.venv/bin/uvicorn eoapi.{SERVICE}.app:app --port 8000 --reload
```

Note: services might have incompatible dependencies which you can resolve by using virtual environement per service
